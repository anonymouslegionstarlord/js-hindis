JAvascript execution context 

1)   {} Global execution context referes to  "this" variable
window object

2)   Function Execution context

3)   Eval Execution Context



{} Memory Creation Phase - Place allocation
Execution Phase

Eg- let val1 =10
    let val2 = 5
    Function addNum (num1,num2){
        let total = num1 +num2
        return total
    }

    let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
    let result2 = addNum(10,2)


    1. Global execution -> this
    2. Memory creation Phase -> val1 = undefined
                                val2= undefined
                                addNum = function definition
                                result1 = undefined
                                result2= undefined

    3. Execution Phase
    val1 =10
    val2 =5
    addNum = new var environment +  execution thread

    Memory Phase 
    val1 =undefined
    val2 =undefined
    total = undefined


    Execution Context
    num1 =10
    num2=5
    total=15

    also gets deleted after execution


    result1=15




    result2 = new var environment +  execution thread

Memory Phase 
    val1 =undefined
    val2 =undefined
    total = undefined


    Execution Context
    num1 =10
    num2=2
    total=12

    result2 = 12
